    <textOnly>Hello {!Lead.FirstName},

I hope you’re having a great week and that you returned home safely from Chicago. I sincerely enjoyed meeting you at this year’s CRS ICT4D Conference, and learning about what you do at {!Lead.Company}.

Should you be interested in learning more about our mobile solution CommCare, please visit our website commcarehq.org, read about our work at dimagi.com or reach out to me directly.

I would like to connect sometime to learn more about your organization, and share with you a bit about our work in ICT4D. Let me know if you are up for a brief phone call and we can go from there.


My best,

Alexandra Morgan-Kisarale
