{!Lead.FirstName},

Thanks for reading our Sales and Marketing eBook, The Evolution of Sales:Survival Guide. One interesting fact from this research that jumped out at me was how high performing companies are using video throughout the sales cycle as a new means of prospect conversion, lead nurturing, closing deals and post sale communications— connect, present, chat, share and collaborate are all traits of a better sales call. I&apos;d like to talk to you about how the right meeting technology — either on the go or at your desk — can help build stronger relationships with your prospects and customers

I&apos;ll give you a call soon.
