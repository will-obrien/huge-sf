{!Lead.FirstName},

Thanks for reading our research brief, Adding Webconferencing Tools To Tablets Fosters Mobile Collaboration. One stat from Forrester’s research that jumped out at me was that 72% of tablet users report that meeting access — either getting everyone into a meeting or participating in a meeting away from a desktop or laptop — is the main stumbling block to using webconferencing at their companies. I&apos;d like to talk to you about how the right meeting technology — either on the go or at your desk — can help you save costs and time.

I&apos;ll give you a call soon.
