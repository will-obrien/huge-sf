    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

Thanks for attending our webinar &quot;How to Engage the Right Buyers in 2013&quot; last week. As Andy explained in his presentation, the secret to meeting sales revenue targets is to develop personal connections using social media, leverage that knowledge into relevant sales messages with context and deliver those messages via an engaging communication platform, like iMeet.

I’d like to schedule a time to show you how valuable iMeet is as a sales tool.

In the meantime, view the recorded webinar by clicking here: http://www.sellingpower.com/webinars2/2012/recording/12/13/

I’ll be in touch soon.

Best regards,
