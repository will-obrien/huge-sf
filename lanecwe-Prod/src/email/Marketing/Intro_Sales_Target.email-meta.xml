YOUR ONE SOURCE

FOR ALL THE WAYS YOU NEED TO MEET

  

Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

As your PGi account manager, I want to introduce you to all the services that we currently provide your company, and share useful information that Sales professionals value, like:


 
	- Which web conferencing options work best for client presentations, sales training and engagement
	- How you can use video conferencing to have more personal connections with your customers and your remote sales teams
	- Who to contact if you need a PGi Event Specialist to help you set-up and host a larger event, like an all-hands call
	- How to get the most out of your day-to-day meetings by taking advantage of all the features available to you
	- Where you can find online resources for training &amp; support 
 Do you have 15 minutes?

I&apos;d like to learn more about your needs so I can recommend some specific solutions. I will call to get some time on your calendar and you are welcome to contact me at your convenience.


Regards,
