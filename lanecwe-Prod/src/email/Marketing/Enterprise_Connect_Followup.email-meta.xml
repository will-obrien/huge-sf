{!Lead.FirstName},

Thanks for stopping by the PGi booth at Enterprise Connect! As a forward-thinking business professional, I thought you might be interested in this Forrester tech adoption research study on mobile collaboration, Adding Webconferencing Tools To Tablets Fosters Mobile Collaboration. One stat from Forrester’s research that jumped out at me was that 72% of tablet users report that meeting access — either getting everyone into a meeting or participating in a meeting away from a desktop or laptop — is the main stumbling block to using webconferencing at their companies. I&apos;d like to talk to you about how the right meeting technology — either on the go or at your desk — can help you save costs and time.

I&apos;ll follow up with you shortly to discuss how PGi&apos;s solutions can improve communication and collaboration across your organization.
