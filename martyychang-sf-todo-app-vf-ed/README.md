This sample app was created by @martyychang in preparation for a Lightning Components presentation for salesforce.com's [Boston Developer Group meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Salesforce-Platform-Developer-User-Group/events/220444530/) on Wednesday, March 11, 2015. The app demonstrates basic Visualforce constructs for creating a single-page app, without using JavaScript Remoting or Visualforce Remote Objects.
